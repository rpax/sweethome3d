	<td><p>To edit Sweet Home 3D preferences, choose <i>Sweet Home 3D &gt; Preferences...</i> under Mac OS X or <i>File &gt; Preferences...</i> under
	    other systems.</p>
	    <p align="center"><img src="images/editingPreferences.png"></p>
	  <p>In the preferences pane, the <i>Language</i> drop down list lets you choose the language used in the user interface of Sweet Home 3D,  
	  	and the button at its right lets you import some additional languages library files with a SH3L extension. <br>
	    The <i>Unit</i> drop down list lets you choose the unit used to draw  the rulers and grid of the home plan, 
	    and to display lengths and areas. 
        <!-- Note to translators: the end of this paragraph should be translated only 
             if users speaking your language actually use imperial system units (i.e. foot/inch). Otherwise, it can be ignored. -->
        <i>Millimeter</i>, <i>Centimeter</i> and <i>Meter</i> units are available 
	    for the metric system, and two units are proposed for the imperial system: the <i>Inch/Decimals</i> unit  which displays lengths only in inches followed 
	    by decimals of an inch, like in <b>250.122&quot;</b>, and the <i>Foot/Inch/Fraction</i> 
	    unit which displays a length in feet and inches followed by the closest eighth inch fraction, like in 
	    <b>20'10&#8539;&quot;</b>. In the latter case, a fractional part typed with decimals and an inch value
	     larger or equal to 12 will be automatically converted; for example, if you type <b>15.75</b>, the program 
	     will understand <b>1'3&#190&quot;</b>, and if you enter <b>2'15</b>, it will be interpreted as <b>3'3&quot;</b>. 
	     You may also use the <b>/</b> character in the fraction after the inch value, like in <b>1 3/4</b>, that the 
	     program will understand as <b>1&#190&quot;</b>. For areas, the <i>Foot/Inch/Fraction</i>  always 
	    displays the closest value in square feet, whereas the <i>Inch/Decimals</i> unit displays some decimals 
	    when necessary.</p>
	  <p> The <i>Currency</i> drop down list lets you choose the currency of furniture prices. When a currency is selected instead of the <i>Ignore prices</i> 
	  default option, you may enter a price in the furniture modification pane, display the <i>Price</i> column in the furniture list and obtain the total 
	  price of object prices under that  list. If the option <i>Use VAT</i> (or <i>Use Sales tax</i> or <i>Use GST</i> according to your country) is selected, 
	  furniture prices are considered as pre-tax prices, and you may enter a <i>VAT</i> / <i>Sales tax</i> / <i>GST</i> percentage in the furniture modification 
	  pane and display additional columns related to taxes in the furniture list.<br>
	  The <i>Category folders</i> and the <i>Searchable list</i> radio buttons 
          let you choose how the furniture catalog should be displayed in each 
        <a href="ui.html">Sweet Home 3D window</a>.</p>
	  <p>The <i>3D navigation arrows</i> check box allows to display arrow buttons 
          that will help you to <a href="editing3DView.html">navigate in the 3D 
        view</a>.<br>
        When enabled, the  <i>Aerial view centered on selection</i> option will center the 3D aerial view 
        on the selected items in the 2D plan. If no item is selected or if this option is disabled, 
        the aerial view will be centered on the center of the home, that may vary according to the items it contains. <br>
        When enabled, the <i>Select visitor in plan at 3D move</i> option will	select and display the virtual visitor 
        drawn in the 2D plan each time you make a move in the 3D view in <i>Virtual visit</i> mode. 
        You should unselect this option if you don't want to lose the current selection in the plan and/or change 
        the visible part of the plan at each move in the 3D view.</p>
      <p>The <i>Magnetism</i> check box enables or disables the magnetism used 
          in the home plan during <a href="drawingWalls.html">walls drawing</a> 
          and <a href="editingFurniture.html">furniture placing</a>.<br>
          The <i>Rulers</i> check box allows to make the rulers around the plan 
          visible or invisible.<br>
          The <i>Grid</i> check box allows to make the grid in the plan visible 
        or invisible.<br>
        The <i>Default font</i> drop down list lets you select the font  used  for texts displayed in the plan 
        (i.e. <a href="editingFurniture.html">furniture</a> name, <a href="editingRooms.html">rooms</a> name and area, 
        <a href="editingDimensions.html">dimension lines</a> length and default font of free <a href="addingTexts.html">texts</a>).<br>
          The <i>Catalog icons</i> and <i>Top view</i> radio buttons let you choose 
          how the furniture should be drawn in the plan (see images below). When the <i>Top view</i> option is selected, 
          the <i>Icon size</i> drop down list lets you select the size in pixels of the icons drawn in the 2D plan. 
          Higher sizes will give nicer plans when drawn at screen, printed and exported to SVG format, 
          but will require more memory to work.<br>
          The <i>Monochrome</i> and <i>Floor color or texture</i> radio buttons 
          let you choose whether rooms should be drawn in plan filled with the 
          color or texture you chose for their floor, or with a grey color (printed 
          as white).<br>
          The <i>New walls pattern in plan</i> drop down list lets you choose the pattern 
        in the plan used to fill the walls  that will be created once the preferences
	        pane will be closed.<br>
          The <i>New walls thickness</i> value sets the thickness of the new walls.<br>
          The <i>New  walls height</i> value 
	        sets the height of the new walls and of the new levels. <br>
        The <i>New levels floor thickness</i> sets the thickness of the floors of new levels. </p>
<p>When selected, the  <i>Check updates at program launch</i> option will check whether 
  some updates of Sweet Home 3D are available or not each time the program is launched, 
  and will display them in a dialog box. This option checks also the availability of some updates for the furniture libraries 
  (SH3F files),  textures libraries (SH3T files),  language libraries (SH3L files) and plug-ins 
  (SH3P files) that you installed, depending on how they are configured. </p>	  
        <p>The value of the field associated to the <i>Save home data for recovery</i> 
          check box sets the delay in minutes between two save operations of the 
          opened homes. These homes are automatically saved in private files, 
          that will be used for recovery purpose at the next launch of Sweet Home 3D 
          if the program crashes.<br>
          Finally, the <i>Reset the display of tips</i> button resets the answers 
          you gave to the check box <i>Do not display this tip again</i> shown 
          in the tips dialog boxes displayed when you click on some tools. This 
          means that all the dialog boxes where you selected this check box will 
          appear again.</p>
